Another Scrapy project!! 

I have only included the items.py file and my "spider".py file, as all others should be taken care of with "Scrapy startproject xyz" command.


Takes the top post from Reddit's /r/programming everyday, and exports the post's title and url to a JSON file, which can then be used for... anything
